📊 Questionnaire Details

Social Media Engagement Questionnaire (SMEQ)

Measures usage frequency at specific times (before sleep, after waking, meals, etc.).

Responses range from 0–7 scale.

Self-Esteem Scale

Based on Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (10 items).

Uses reverse scoring for negatively worded items (Q2, Q5, Q6, Q8, Q9).

Final score range: 10–40 (higher = higher self-esteem).

🧹 Data Management

Delete Entries: Use the checkbox in the table to remove specific responses.

Download Data: Export all collected responses as a CSV.

📌 Notes

This is a client-side only app — all data is stored in the participant’s browser.

For multi-user or production scenarios, you should replace LocalStorage with a proper database backend (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, Firebase).
